		<speaker>Marvin</speaker>
		<line>Ah... you’re finally awake. What a peculiar miracle you are… and what perfect timing.</line>
		<line>Allow me to introduce myself. They call me Marvin, though some in these woods remember me as the sage of the mangrove. I’ve walked among roots and ashes longer than I can count… but never have I seen a creature like you.</line>
		<line>Listen. This forest, this home, this world… it’s withering. Life is fading. The flora is sick. The fauna, maddened. Do you know why?</line>
		<line>Not long ago, a gem fell from the sky. A cursed stone, corrupted, alien to all natural form. It shattered, and its energy… spread like poison.</line>
		<line>Two fragments. Two cores of power that now pulse uncontrollably, causing mutations, disease… death.</line>
		<line>Through my years of study in science, I’ve learned more than you can imagine. I’m sure that with my knowledge, I could reverse the damage—but not with my own qualities. Someone like me cannot move forward against this.</line>
		<line>But you… you are not like the others. You could… endure. You could… restore.</line>
		<line>If we manage to gather those fragments… we could rebuild the gem. Not to unleash its power, no… but to seal it. To lock the darkness away again. To heal the forest.</line>
		<line>Help me, creature. I’m not asking for violence. Just… do what you already do. What your instinct tells you. Gather what has been lost.</line>

		<speaker>Marvin</speaker>
		<line>Ah... there you are. Just in time. I knew you wouldn’t stop. You are… persistent.</line>
		<line>I see you’ve already found one of the fragments. I felt it… from afar. Its energy resonates with you. It’s… perfect.</line>
		<line>You must continue. Further west… in the heart of the high forest lies the second one. Protected, hidden… corrupted. You must not fail.</line>
		<line>The creatures there… are wilder. The corruption runs deep. But you, you only act when necessary, right?</line>
		<line>Don’t be alarmed if you see signs… of battle on me. Sometimes… trees give way, or animals… fight among themselves. It’s chaos. The forest is sick. Nothing more.</line>
		<line>Just keep going. Look for the high places, the hollow canopies. The fragment will find you… just like the first.</line>
		<line>But you must hurry, we must act at once or it will be the end of the forest.</line>
		<line>Do not delay.</line>

		<speaker>Eira</speaker>
		<line>Ah! I heard you. Smells like warm mud. It's you, right? I'm Eira.</line>
		<line>Hey. Do you know how to open that plug? I've been stuck here for a while… Maybe you can lift it from above mhm… what should I call you?</line>
		<line> ...</line>
		<line>You and I… it always ends the same way… I hope this time hurts less.</line>
		<line> ...</line>
		<line>Are you helping or not? If we try to lift it… it might open. When you're done, I’ll see you on the other side.</line>

		<speaker>Eira</speaker>
		<line>Brrr! This is a mess! Who put this burrow here? There's no way to find safety like this.</line>
		<line>Don’t think I’m hiding in there, friend slime. I’m not afraid of those monsters. I’m searching for and opening every burrow in the forest so animals can take shelter.</line>
		<line>Still...</line>
		<line>Don’t let the darkness consume you again.</line>
		<line>Come on slime. Help me unlock it. Who knows, you might even find something interesting. Burrows are where treasures are kept, you know. I’ll see you on the other side.</line>

	<dialogue id="23">
		<speaker>Eira</speaker>
		<line>Who are you? You look like someone. Or maybe you're the same person. I don't know... Friend slime? Oh, I didn’t realize it was you.</line>
		<line>Are you going to help me or… just stand there like the others? If you feel like being altruistic, get ready to work. We need to reach that burrow but it's all collapsed. Maybe you can make a path, friend. I’ll see you on the other side.</line>
		<line>Thank you, you're the best. You're going to help so many of us who live in the forest. Who wouldn't trust you? Thanks for always using your time to help me. You are…</line>
		<line>You are the crack… or the seal. The remnant of hope… or the final step toward oblivion.</line>
		<line>...</line>
		<line>After this I’ll head to the Boreal Forest. Follow me if you want to keep helping.</line>
		<line>Don't do it! Don’t look for me in the Boreal Forest!</line>
		<line>...</line>
		<line>Come on slime, hurry up! Those shelters won’t open themselves.</line>

		<line>🎵 Fresh carrots, crunch in my mouth, I run through the field, I’ll never be alone. 🎵</line>
		<line>It hurts… it hurt before. Not now. Not… after.</line>
		<line>Hello friend slime. You caught me just as I was looking for an injured one in this burrow. I know I ask a lot, but I need your help one more time.</line>
		<line>We're still in time to save many.</line>
		<line>...</line>
		<line>I heard someone groaning and calling for help down the right path. There are lots of obstacles I can’t move, but maybe you can. I’ll keep looking for shelters or injured animals down below while you take care of this.</line>
		<line>She won’t survive. She’ll be a prisoner of her obsession. She’s lying to you, he did this to us… You can still stop him.</line>
		<line>...</line>
		<line>Hey slime, I trust you. See you on the other side, friend!</line>

		<speaker>Eira</speaker>
		<line>Huh? What are you doing in here? This was my spot…</line>
		<line>Ah… Sorry, friend slime. I took shelter wherever I could. I like this place, it's spacious and warm. Feels like before everything. Don’t you think? I know you won’t talk, but I’m sure you agree ha, ha, ha.</line>
		<line>We didn’t have to meet, but something led me here. I guess our future pulled me to our past. You weren’t like this. At the beginning. Or maybe you were. I don’t know. Maybe next time will be different…</line>
		<line>I want to run… I want to go back to when everything was green…</line>
		<line>It won’t work...</line>
		<line>You’ll have to be careful. You can still change things, friend slime. This time.</line>
		<line>...</line>
		<line>I guess… see you on the other side… I’m ready for before. And you?</line>
		<line>...</line>
		<line>Got it! I’ll call you slime, friend slime, or slime friend. Do you like it?</line>
		<line>...</line>

		<speaker>Flik</speaker>
		<line>Woah! That was close! That moldy-smelling specter almost swallowed me whole… They're huge, and honestly, they freak me out. Ah! And what are you? A mutant jelly or a slime with a soul? You're not gonna try to absorb me like they do, right?</line>
		<line>Nah, just kidding. Name's Flik. King of the heights! And you? Not much of a talker, huh?</line>
		<line>Well then, keep it that way, slippery silence. Sometimes it's better to listen than to babble. I don’t know what a slimy blob like you is doing here, but if you’re looking for the entrance to the Boreal Forest, you’re on the right track. Just be careful—easy to slip up ahead. Good luck, little snot!</line>

	<dialogue id="32">
		<speaker>Flik</speaker>
		<line>Oh, slippery slime! You’re looking good—hope you didn’t run into any big monsters. Scary, right? Honestly, it’s amazing you made it through all that with such style. But the style show’s not over yet. You’ve arrived just in time to help me. I need… something… muscular. Or slimy.</line>
		<line>Look, there’s a chamber up here. I can feel a fresh breeze coming in. But that rock—oof. It’s blocking the entrance. Can you push it?</line>
		<line>My sister would dive right in without a second thought. Always first. Always faster. Always slipperier…</line>

	<dialogue id="33">
		<speaker>Flik</speaker>
		<line>Hey, finally! I thought you got stuck to some log.</line>
		<line>I know you’re wondering what I’m doing in a place like this. I’ll be honest. When all this started, I lost my little sister. I’ve been looking for her ever since. This place… I knew it. My sister used to say that stones carry energy.</line>
		<line>Do you think rocks really hold energy? Sometimes I feel like I can sense… my sister.</line>
		<line>Alright, enough drama. Up here there’s a spot you might be able to hang from. I bet there’s a hole up top, and I’d wager my tail there’s something awesome hidden in it. Shall we find out?</line>
