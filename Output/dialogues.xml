		<line>Ah, traveler. It's been quite some time since a new face wandered into these parts. Most who pass through are either lost, fleeing from something they dare not name, or searching for answers buried so deep they no longer remember the questions. This land remembers every step, every whisper, and every regret. Tread carefully—some doors, once opened, never truly close.</line>
		<line>Many have come seeking glory, but few have returned alive.</line>
		<line>If your steps have brought you to me, it's because fate has something in store for you.</line>
		<line>They say that in the northern ruins lies an ancient power—but also a curse.</line>
		<line>Be careful. And if you choose to go, take this stone. It will show you the way when the moon is high.</line>

		<line>Are you also looking to face the beasts of the valley?</line>
		<line>I've lost more comrades than I can count in those cursed lands.</line>
		<line>If you're still determined, take this spear. It's not new, but it's killed more monsters than you've ever seen.</line>
