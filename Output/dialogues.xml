		<line>Ah... you’re finally awake. What a peculiar miracle you are… and what perfect timing.</line>
		<line>Allow me to introduce myself. They call me Marvin, though some in these woods remember me as the sage of the mangrove. I’ve walked among roots and ashes longer than I can count... but never have I seen a creature like you.</line>
		<line>Listen. This forest, this home, this world... it’s withering. Life is fading. The flora is sick. The fauna, maddened. Do you know why?</line>
		<line>Not long ago, a gem fell from the sky. A cursed stone, corrupted, alien to all natural form. It shattered, and its energy... spread like poison.</line>
		<line>Two fragments. Two cores of power that now pulse uncontrollably, causing mutations, disease... death.</line>
		<line>Through my years of study in science, I’ve learned more than you can imagine. I’m sure that with my knowledge, I could reverse the damage—but not with my own qualities. Someone like me cannot move forward against this.</line>
		<line>But you... you are not like the others. You could... endure. You could... restore.</line>
		<line>If we manage to gather those fragments... we could rebuild the gem. Not to unleash its power, no... but to seal it. To lock the darkness away again. To heal the forest.</line>
		<line>Help me, creature. I’m not asking for violence. Just... do what you already do. What your instinct tells you. Gather what has been lost.</line>

		<speaker>Marvin</speaker>
		<line>Ah... there you are. Just in time. I knew you wouldn’t stop. You are… persistent.</line>
		<line>I see you’ve already found one of the fragments. I felt it... from afar. Its energy resonates with you. It’s... perfect.</line>
		<line>You must continue. Further west... in the heart of the high forest lies the second one. Protected, hidden… corrupted. You must not fail.</line>
		<line>The creatures there... are wilder. The corruption runs deep. But you, you only act when necessary, right?</line>
		<line>Just keep going. Look for the high places, the hollow canopies. The fragment will find you... just like the first.</line>
		<line>But you must hurry, we must act at once or it will be the end of the forest.</line>
		<line>Do not delay.</line>

		<speaker>Marvin</speaker>
		<line>Do you have them?</line>
		<line>The fragments, give them to me!</line>
		<line>Now's not the time for stalling, slime!</line>
		<line>Don’t be alarmed if you see signs... of battle on me. Sometimes… trees give way, or animals... fight among themselves. It’s chaos. The forest is sick. Nothing more.</line>
		<line>Everything depends on this. Hand them over!</line>

		<speaker>Marvin Note</speaker>
		<line>DAY 147 OF THE DRY-STEM CYCLE</line>
		<line>Location: Temporary lab, Inner Mangrove</line>
		<line>Log Type: Observation Record 004-B</line>
		<line>The fragment emits a steady pulse.</line>
		<line>Energy oscillates at 11.2 per short cycle.</line>
		<line>Surface temperature remains stable,</line>
		<line>even in harsh conditions.</line>
		<line>When exposed to strong mental stimuli,</line>
		<line>especially grief, creation, or longing,</line>
		<line>the core shifts in color spectrum.</line>
		<line>From deep purple to greenish amber.</line>
		<line>It may reflect emotional echoes,</line>
		<line>or resonant memory reactions.</line>
		<line>This is no crystal. No lifeform either.</line>
		<line>It is not of this world.</line>
		<line>Its internal geometry is unnatural,</line>
		<line>following patterns that defy replication.</line>
		<line>Was it discovered by another species?</line>
		<line>Or built by them?</line>
		<line>Either way, its design surpasses ours</line>
		<line>by centuries—maybe millennia.</line>
		<line>This changes everything.</line>
		<line>I remember why I was called a researcher.</line>
		<line>This time… I’ll fix what was broken.</line>

		<line>Day 163 of the Dry Stem Cycle</line>
		<line>Location: Observation Ridge, Deep Roots Sector</line>
		<line>Classification: Incident Note 007-A</line>
		<line>Something unexpected occurred today.</line>
		<line>A hare approached the artifact chamber.</line>
		<line>She crossed the wards undetected—</line>
		<line>even the scent traps and sound echoes failed.</line>
		<line>She touched the core. Just briefly.</line>
		<line>But I saw it: the pulse reacted violently.</line>
		<line>It bent toward her like a root seeking water.</line>
		<line>Then—light. Sharp. Sudden. Gone.</line>
		<line>The hare screamed and collapsed,</line>
		<line>then stood… changed.</line>
		<line>She wandered away in silence.</line>
		<line>I followed. For days, I observed.</line>
		<line>She now speaks nonsense—</line>
		<line>phrases from different seasons,</line>
		<line>events not yet happened, or long past.</line>
		<line>Her mind, I believe, is no longer fixed in time.</line>
		<line>The artifact has severed her sequence.</line>
		<line>This proves the core's reach over temporality.</line>
		<line>Time, to it, is flexible. Subjective. Mutable.</line>
		<line>If it can untether memory—</line>
		<line>perhaps it can untether death.</line>

		<line>Day 174 of the Dry Stem Cycle</line>
		<line>Location: Rootfall Sanctuary (sealed chamber)</line>
		<line>Classification: Private Entry 011-X</line>
		<line>I have stopped sleeping.</line>
		<line>The artifact hums even when silent.</line>
		<line>It enters dreams I no longer have.</line>
		<line>Its angles—</line>
		<line>they continue to grow inside my sketches,</line>
		<line>twisting into new dimensions.</line>
		<line>I see them now behind leaves and stone.</line>
		<line>The forest rejects me, yes, but it does not matter.</line>
		<line>What lives inside this core is perfect.</line>
		<line>A pattern, recursive and infinite.</line>
		<line>Not magic. Not life. Something… prior.</line>
		<line>I was never meant to understand it fully,</line>
		<line>but that will not stop me.</line>
		<line>Each pulse, each shift, each resonance—</line>
		<line>they bring me closer.</line>
		<line>Closer to what was lost.</line>
		<line>Closer to what must return.</line>
		<line>This world is not ready for it.</line>

		<line>And I will not let them take this from me again.</line>

		<line>Ah! I heard you. Smells like warm mud. It's you, right? I'm Eira.</line>
		<line>Hey. Do you know how to open that plug? I've been stuck here for a while... Maybe you can lift it from above mhm… what should I call you?</line>
		<line> ...</line>
		<line>You and I… it always ends the same way... I hope this time hurts less.</line>
		<line> ...</line>
		<line>Are you helping or not? If we try to lift it... it might open. When you're done, I’ll see you on the other side.</line>

		<speaker>Eira</speaker>
		<line>Brrr! This is a mess! Who put this burrow here? There's no way to find safety like this.</line>
		<line>Don’t think I’m hiding in there, friend slime. I’m not afraid of those monsters. I’m searching for and opening every burrow in the forest so animals can take shelter.</line>
		<line>Still...</line>
		<line> don’t let the darkness consume you again.</line>
		<line>Come on slime. Help me unlock it. Who knows, you might even find something interesting. Burrows are where treasures are kept, you know. I’ll see you on the other side.</line>

		<line>Who are you? You look like someone. Or maybe you're the same person. I don't know... Friend slime? Oh, I didn’t realize it was you.</line>
		<line>Are you going to help me or... just stand there like the others? If you feel like being altruistic, get ready to work. We need to reach that burrow but it's all collapsed. Maybe you can make a path, friend. I’ll see you on the other side.</line>
		<line>Thank you, you're the best. You're going to help so many of us who live in the forest. Who wouldn't trust you? Thanks for always using your time to help me. You are...</line>
		<line>You are the crack... or the seal. The remnant of hope... or the final step toward oblivion.</line>
		<line>...</line>
		<line>After this I’ll head to the Boreal Forest. Follow me if you want to keep helping.</line>
		<line>Don't do it! Don’t look for me in the Boreal Forest!</line>

		<line>It hurts,,, it hurt before. Not now. Not... after.</line>
		<line>Hello friend slime. You caught me just as I was looking for an injured one in this burrow. I know I ask a lot, but I need your help one more time.</line>
		<line>We're still in time to save many.</line>
		<line>...</line>
		<line>I heard someone groaning and calling for help down the right path. There are lots of obstacles I can’t move, but maybe you can. I’ll keep looking for shelters or injured animals down below while you take care of this.</line>
		<line> she won’t survive. She’ll be a prisoner of his obsession. He’s lying to you, he did this to us… You can still stop him.</line>

		<line>Huh? What are you doing in here? This was my spot...</line>
		<line>Ah... Sorry, friend slime. I took shelter wherever I could. I like this place, it's spacious and warm. Feels like before everything. Don’t you think? I know you won’t talk, but I’m sure you agree ha, ha, ha.</line>
		<line>We didn’t have to meet, but something led me here. I guess our future pulled me to our past. You weren’t like this. At the beginning. Or maybe you were. I don’t know. Maybe next time will be different...</line>
		<line>I want to run... I want to go back to when everything was green…</line>
		<line>It won’t work...</line>
		<line>You’ll have to be careful. You can still change things, friend slime. This time</line>
		<line>...</line>
		<line>I guess… see you on the other side… I’m ready for before. And you?</line>
		<line>...</line>
		<line>Got it! I’ll call you slime, friend slime, or slime friend. Do you like it?</line>

		<line>Woah! That was close! That moldy-smelling specter almost swallowed me whole... They're huge, and honestly, they freak me out. Ah! And what are you? A mutant jelly or a slime with a soul? You're not gonna try to absorb me like they do, right?</line>
		<line>Nah, just kidding. Name's Flik. King of the heights! And you? Not much of a talker, huh?</line>
		<line>Well then, keep it that way, slippery silence. Sometimes it's better to listen than to babble. I don’t know what a slimy blob like you is doing here, but if you’re looking for the entrance to the Boreal Forest, you’re on the right track. Just be careful—easy to slip up ahead. Good luck, little snot!</line>

	<dialogue id="32">
		<speaker>Flik</speaker>
		<line>Oh, slippery slime! You’re looking good—hope you didn’t run into any big monsters. Scary, right? Honestly, it’s amazing you made it through all that with such style. But the style show’s not over yet. You’ve arrived just in time to help me. I need... something... muscular. Or slimy.</line>
		<line>Look, there’s a chamber up here. I can feel a fresh breeze coming in. But that rock—oof. It’s blocking the entrance. Can you push it?</line>
		<line>My sister would dive right in without a second thought. Always first. Always faster. Always slipperier...</line>

		<speaker>Flik</speaker>
		<line>Hey, finally! I thought you got stuck to some log.</line>
		<line>I know you’re wondering what I’m doing in a place like this. I’ll be honest. When all this started, I lost my little sister. I’ve been looking for her ever since. This place… I knew it. My sister used to say that stones carry energy.</line>
		<line>Do you think rocks really hold energy? Sometimes I feel like I can sense... my sister.</line>
		<line>Alright, enough drama. Up here there’s a spot you might be able to hang from. I bet there’s a hole up top, and I’d wager my tail there’s something awesome hidden in it. Shall we find out?</line>

		<line>If you untangle that knot,</line>
		<line>I promise to show you a shortcut.</line>
		<line>Hey… Do you think if someone falls…</line>
		<line>they can fly again?</line>
		<line>My dad used to say a squirrel on a branch</line>
		<line>should never fear the branch breaking,</line>
		<line>because their trust isn’t in the branch…</line>
		<line>it’s in their wings.</line>
		<line>Forget it. Look, you’ve got two paths.</line>
		<line>That hole leads to a hidden chamber.</line>
		<line>The other way is a steep exit.</line>
		<line>Or you can go back if you’re not sure.</line>
		<line>You choose.</line>
		<line>I try to stay positive, y'know…</line>
		<line>But I’m running out of places to look, Slimey.</line>
		<line>I’m losing hope.</line>
		<line>But she must be out there, safe.</line>
		<line>She has to be.</line>
		<line>She always beat me in races…</line>
		<line>I know she’s okay.</line>

		<line>Or hide.</line>
		<line>I found her.</line>

		<line>Why didn’t I hear her sooner?</line>

		<line>Dear N.,</line>
		<line>Sorry for the damp paper and green ink.</line>
		<line>Supplies have been low since the last storm.</line>
		<line>But I couldn’t stay silent anymore.</line>
		<line>I haven’t heard from Marvin in days.</line>
		<line>Someone saw him near the eastern edge of the mangrove,</line>
		<line>but no one’s managed to get close.</line>
		<line>I’m not surprised, really.</line>
		<line>He spent a whole cycle locked in his workshop,</line>
		<line>barely stepping into the sunlight.</line>
		<line>The last thing he told me was:</line>
		<line>“I’m close to something big.”</line>
		<line>I laughed. You know how he was with discoveries.</line>
		<line>They were always just about to change the world.</line>
		<line>Then the council shut his lab down.</line>
		<line>That place was the last thing holding him together.</line>
		<line>Days later, youngsters broke in.</line>
		<line>They burned and stole everything.</line>
		<line>They called it dangerous trash. Maybe they were right.</line>
		<line>Still… no one deserves that.</line>
		<line>His wife died five cycles ago,</line>
		<line>from some irreversible condition.</line>
		<line>His daughter followed three cycles later.</line>
		<line>I don’t know how he didn’t break sooner.</line>
		<line>Or maybe he did, and no one noticed.</line>
		<line>I tried. I swear I did.</line>
		<line>But he always seemed to talk more to his flasks than to us.</line>
		<line>Still… I worry.</line>
